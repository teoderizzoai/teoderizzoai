## 🎧 Currently Working On: Spotify Hit Predictor – *“Will It Hit?”*

I'm actively developing an AI-powered platform that predicts whether a song has hit potential based on **Spotify audio features**.

- 🧠 **Core Focus**: Training and integrating machine learning models using features like **danceability**, **energy**, **valence**, and more.
- 🛠️ **Tech Stack**: `React`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Vite`, `Express.js`, `Python (scikit-learn, XGBoost)`, and the `Spotify Web API`.
- 🎵 **User Flow**: Upload an audio file, Spotify URI, or CSV → extract features → get instant hit probability.
- 📊 **What's Next**:
  - Enhancing **model accuracy** with advanced ensemble methods and feature engineering
  - Adding **interactive visual breakdowns** of predictions
  - Implementing **OAuth login** and **user prediction history dashboard**

🚧 *Currently building out backend ML integration and real-time feedback features. Public beta coming soon!*
